# FindTheHat

My solution to the Find the Hat challenge project from CodeCademy

## Features
This project can generate a random field of your choosing with a probability for obstacle generation. Additionally, I added a path array and so the project keeps a track of the movement of the character and has a current character icon and a path character icon, you cannot go through your own path, to add both difficulty and to remove the case where you are lost in where your character is within the old path.
